{start} supposed to be a {p}.
{start} pretty useless, and annoying to type.
{start} line 2 of the {p}.
{start} is something @xeldrago wants us to do.
\tTo write a {p} and use {strf} in writing the {p}

{start} is pointless.
The concept of {strf} is not very useful.
At least not the {strf} function of the class str.
{start} because there is a need to repetitively define the format by using mutliple braces.
And then to add to the pain, one needs to define the value of each brace.
They really do not make anything easier for anyone. I have never seen any programmer need to type such a long {p}.
But returning to the topic. {start} is supposed to be a {p} about Covid-19.

{start} all that needs to be said about it.
