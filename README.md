# learn-python
we're going to learn Python by doing small projects. 

at first, we will all work separately on the same task. 
i.e. there will be 3 different programs doing the same thing.
then we'll all discuss and create a new one from scratch using the ones we just made as reference.

each project will be in a separate branch
each branch will have 4 folders
    * final
    * Pro-xlr8
    * xeldrago
    * kevinnls

we will create our app in the respective folders. we are not making a separate branch for each person.
then the final will be our truly *collaborative* effort. learning to write clean code and understand others' code.
